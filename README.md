# Description
A hobby project for creating a pokemon battling simulator for pokemon gen 5. Absent any smogon rules, tiers, other nonsense.
## TODO List
- program checks itself against the current version available on github on button press
- an interface to build a team
- display accurate statistics in that interface, including available moves
- animated sprites
